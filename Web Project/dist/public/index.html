          <p> 
            <b>Caleb:</b> I am a third year Multimedia student who specializes in Java, Javascript, C++ and web design. I pick up new things quickly and I am always striving to learn. I am interested in solving coding challenges and finding ways to improve anything I come across. I am an avid Destiny 2 player; I play as a Hunter which fits with my chaotic and fun-seeking personality. I also enjoy listening to rock music. My toxic trait is climbing on top of anything that has hand-holds, and my claim to fame is having a song or a meme for any situation. 
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b>Liezelle:</b> Hi! My name is Liezelle. I’m studying Computer Science doing my third year. I have a passion for ICT mainly the front end development. The look and feel of applications rather than the backend. I’m knowledgeable in Java , C++ and a bit of HTML. I’m a creative so in my spare time I sketch, paint, sew and do some crocheting.

            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b>Jarod:</b> I am a software developer that specializes in backend development with a small amount of frontend capabilities. I have worked freelance for a few companies and developed admin and sales systems that allow for streamlined sales and HR management.
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b>Cassim:</b> I specialise in both web development and UI design, but my main feat is visuals and animation since it's my passion and strengths. As a multimedia dev, I use these skills to make sure every piece of content is intractable, enjoyable to you and communicates what's best so you can take something from it so I hope you can take something special from our site! 
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <b>Andrea:</b> A BIS Multimedia student focused primarily on frontend development and content creation. Highly skilled in using Node.js, Unity, and the Adobe Suite. In my free time, I write short stories, do crosswords, and play Dungeons & Dragons.

              <br/>
              <br/>
            Inspired by hidden object games such as the Agatha Christie game series and choice-based games/series such as the game House and the Netflix series Bandersnatch, this game is aimed at those who enjoy mystery and thriller-based games/stories and those who enjoy narrative gameplay.
