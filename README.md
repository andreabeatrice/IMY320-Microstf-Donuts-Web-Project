## Overview
For this group assignment, you are required to design and develop a website for a self-made
content creation company (your group). The website should serve as a general portfolio of the
projects the company have done and advertise the services available (animation, interface
design, game creation, etc.). Your website should incorporate several trends that were discussed
in class and be designed around interactivity and user experience.

All content used on the website should be generated and created by the group. It is advised that
you use past projects from previous years and this year to fill the content of the website. The
website will need to showcase at least 10 projects to which the company has contributed.
These projects should include:

* A large showcase (IMY 300 game, or COS 301 project)
* Five projects from the module (3D model, Group UX revamp, Group Design ABCD, Individual
assignments)
* And four other projects of your choosing (AI, websites, animation, HCI, etc.)
A large portion of the marks rewarded for this project will be based on the creativity and
uniqueness of the website.
